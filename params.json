RepRouter is an open source [CNC router](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC_router) that is able to replicate itself, as well as making other useful objects.\r\n\r\nIn contrary to 3D printing which uses additive method to make things, CNC routing removes unnecessary materials from pre-formed shapes. This makes it better over 3D printing when making large parts. Also there's a wider choices of materials. For example, RepRouter can shape most of plastics, wood panels, and soft metals (such as aluminium).\r\n\r\nRepRouter is a one of [TaoMaker](http://www.taomaker.com)'s open source project licensed under GPL Version 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Features & Benefits\r\n* RepRouter is an **open source** project. Everyone has access to the drawings (or the \"plan\") and assembly instructions. Feel free to use it to make your own machine. If you folk this project and make changes, you are encouraged to _push_ your modifications.\r\n* Same as other projects started by TaoMaker, it is **simplistic**. It targets at meeting only the necessary features.\r\n* The machine consists only standard components and CNC-routed lumber/plastic boards. This means it is extremely **affordable and very easy to DIY**.\r\n* It is self-replicable/replicating (not applicable for version 0.1 to 0.3). You can have all the body parts made from another RepRouter or other CNC routers, and you can make more RepRouter once you have one RepRouter.\r\n\r\n## Old Versions\r\n* Version 0.3 was improved Version 0.2 which replaces cross-dowel board connections with screw mounts. It attended Maker Faire Bay Area 2012.\r\n* Version 0.2 improved rigidity and gantry stability. Also it started to use CNC-router cut boards, since laser cutting for thick lumber boards are not manufacturing friendly.\r\n* Version 0.1 is the preliminary design with laser-cut boards, designed in 2011.\r\n\r\n## Disclamer\r\nThis design is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
